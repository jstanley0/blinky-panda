an electronic art project, basically

I made this for the design challenge, to learn KiCad better, to test out fabrication of a non-rectangular board, and for soldering practice.

There are 25 LEDs logically arranged in a 5x5 matrix, and a simple timer-driven program that drives them with independent 6-bit software PWM.
